# Predicting Bank Term Deposits
## Stephen Reagin and Trevor Sauerbrey

The Bank Marketing dataset is a CSV file based on the marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution, with observations recorded from May 2008 to November 2012. The purpose of these campaigns was to encourage potential clients to sign up for a bank term deposit, which was sucessfully recorded for 11.7% of all observations. The dataset has more than 45,000 observations of 17 total variables, 10 of which are naturally categorical and 7 of which are given to us as numerical, integers, or continous values.

This is the repository for our final group project, containing all data, analysis files, and image files associated with the final project.
